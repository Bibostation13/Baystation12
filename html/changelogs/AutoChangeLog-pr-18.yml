changes:
  - rscadd: Added a whole smorgasbord of new augment options, which you can obtain
      in a variety of ways.
  - rscadd: Traitors can access an Augments section in their uplink to buy CBMs -
      compact bionic modules that can be used to self-install augments with no medical
      skill. They are, however, very painful to use.
  - rscadd: Added an Augments section to character loadout for minor augments.
  - rscadd: Added a selection of fluff augments that do nothing mechanically, and
      exist purely for roleplay purposes. You can get them from roundstart loadouts.
  - tweak: Integrated HUD augments can now be picked at roundstart by appropriate
      roles.
  - tweak: Some augments can now be discovered by grab-inspecting the body part they're
      on.
  - tweak: Medical records now differentiate between roundstart prosthetics and roundstart
      augments.
  - bugfix: Hidden augments are now fully hidden on body scanners instead of showing
      on the "internal organs" list as a mechanical prosthetic.
  - bugfix: HUD augments now let you control medical status/security status/etc when
      examining another person.
